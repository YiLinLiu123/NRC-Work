##   Goal:
The goal is to look into how to access APIs for various data sources:
Facebook, twitter, Instagram/Flickr and weather purely through the usage 
of R.


*****


##  Facebook:
*   [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api)

***** 

*   ___Advantages:___
    +   Easy to retrieve data from facebook API using 
        the functions provided by the __Rfacebook__. 
        
    +   Easy to access public data of facebook through its [__search API__](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-API/using-graph-API#search).
        Part of the functionality is covered by the _Rfacebook_ package through the _searchGroup &
        searchPages_ function.
        
    +   Long lived tokens created through registering an facebook application
        does not expire.
        
    +   Discussions about a post can be easily tracked through extracting
        comments and replies to those comments.
        
    +   The [graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) tool is useful for testing API 
        calls to understand structure as well as exploring possible fields and edges.
        
    +   The __Utils.R__ package within _Rfacebook_ provides example frameworks to parse 
        the response JSON nested list into an organized data frame.
        
    +   To use custom API requests, use the _CallAPI_ function in _Rfacebook_ 
        with the request URL to retrieve response.

*****

*   ___Disadvantages:___
    +   The facebook API documentation does not provide specific information regarding [__Rate         Limit__](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-API/advanced/rate-limiting), 
    it specifies that the limit `differs depending on request`.
    
    +   facebook API V2.0 and above place heavy restrictions 
        on accessing personal information. Details
        such as profile information, user timeline etc. are not 
        generally publicly available due to privacy settings.
        It is __not recommended__ to scrape the facebook API to search for user related
        information.
        
    +   To retrieve information regarding nodes, the Id of the node
        is required. This makes tracking objects/searching for
        specific nodes very difficult
        since there is no easy way to obtain the id for specific
        objects of interest (pages, users, comments, etc.).
        
    +   It was observed that many pages, posts and comments
        does not include _location_ information as part of its content.

##  Twitter:
*   [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api)

*****

*   __Advantages:__
    +   The packages available provide easy access to the API.
    
    +   __It is recommended to retrieve _RECENT_ information
    using the Twitter API compared to Facebook API.__
    This is because most information posted on twitter
    is public (tweets, users, etc).
    
    +   The search API for Twitter supports more powerful
    queries for searching public twitter content. 
    
    +   The [twitteR Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html) provide easy 
    access to the Twitter REST API and handles the sorting of retrieved data through
    class wrappers that provide convenient functions to access
    information. Read the documentation for the package for more details.
    
    +   TwitteR package retrieves majority of information that is of interest,
    if not supported by the twitteR, any arbitrary HTTP request
    can be made to the API to retrieve information.
    
    +   Twitter provides a live stream API which allows the retrieval 
    of the new updated information on tweeter. This is a unique feature
    and can be used for real-time tracking for events of interest. 
    
    +   [StreamR](https://github.com/pablobarbera/streamR) provides easy access and convenient use of the stream API
    connecting, saving, parsing of data is all handled. 

*****

*   __Disadvantages:__
    +   Location information is available but often users can fill 
    whatever it desired, thus not most accurate. 
    
    +   The token produced by twitteR is cached internally and not
    provide easy access to the token for use outside of twitteR functions.
    
    +   Due to nature of twitter, it is hard to track how users
    react to tweets posted by other users. This is because the replies is not
    directly connected to the post. 
    
    +   __It is not possible to public search for old tweets (older than a week)
        through the official twitter API.__

##  Google Maps API:

[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/)

*****

*   __Advantages:__
    +   Provides many services including directions between origin and destination,
        geocoding services, matching points to near roads, elevation, etc.
    +   Documentation is clear and very easily understood.
    +   Use basic __HTTP request__ with simple format, making it easy to use.

*   __Disadvantages:__
    +   limited free requests per day. The free
        limit is enough for investigation purposes. If used to process
        large amounts of data, a fee will need to be payed.

*****

##  Weather Web Data:

An basic script was made to scrape the Environment Canada Ottawa website
for hourly updated temperature and 24 hour forecast.
The collected data was then explored by making several graphs.

*****

##  Instagram:

*   From initial searching, the Instagram API is not publicly available.
    In order to access the API, an Instagram approved application (only applications
    that promote sharing through Instagram can be approved). Since the API
    is not available, not further search into Instagram was done.

*****

##  Image Metadata:

*   As part of the search into processing images through Instagram, 
    a command prompt tool for windows called [exifTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/),
    which allows the extraction of images metadata.

*****

##  Flickr:

*   Flicker is a photo sharing website which allows people to host 
    their photos online.

*   [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)

*   __The API is not maintained or supported by Flickr.__

****

*   __Advantages:__
    +   Allows public access with relative ease.
    +   Many methods does not require OAuth 1.0 token.
    +   Photos usually contain meta data.
    +   Photo tags provide an easy way to adjust search query.
    

*   __Disadvantages:__
    +   Does not have massive amounts of data available
        like twitter. This is because many photos are 
        not public.
    +   Limited requests.
