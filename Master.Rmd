#   Summary:

*****

##  Facebook:
*   [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api)

***** 

*   ___Advantages:___
    +   Easy to retrieve data from facebook API using 
        the functions provided by the __Rfacebook__. 
    +   Easy to access public data of facebook through its [__search API__](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-API/using-graph-API#search).
        Part of the functionality is covered by the _Rfacebook_ package through the _searchGroup &
        searchPages_ function.
    +   Long lived tokens created through registering an facebook application
        does not expire.
    +   Discussions about a post can be easily tracked through extracting
        comments and replies to those comments.
    +   The [graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) tool is useful for testing API 
        calls to understand structure as well as exploring possible fields and edges.
    +   The __Utils.R__ package within _Rfacebook_ provides example frameworks to parse 
        the response JSON nested list into an organized data frame.
    +   To use custom API requests, use the _CallAPI_ function in _Rfacebook_ 
        with the request URL to retrieve response.

*****

*   ___Disadvantages:___
    +   The facebook API documentation does not provide specific information regarding [__Rate         Limit__](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-API/advanced/rate-limiting), 
    it specifies that the limit `differs depending on request`.
    +   facebook API V2.0 and above place heavy restrictions 
        on accessing personal information. Details
        such as profile information, user timeline etc. are not 
        generally publicly available due to privacy settings.
        It is __not recommended__ to scrape the facebook API to search for user related
        information.
    +   To retrieve information regarding nodes, the Id of the node
        is required. This makes tracking objects/searching for
        specific nodes very difficult
        since there is no easy way to obtain the id for specific
        objects of interest (pages, users, comments, etc.)
    +   It was observed that many pages, posts and comments
        does not include _location_ information as part of its content.

##  Twitter:
*   [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api)

*****

*   __Advantages:__
    +   The packages provide easy access to the API.
    +   __It is recommended to retrieve information
    using the Twitter API compared to Facebook API.__
    This is because most information posted on twitter
    is public (tweets, users, etc).
    +   The search API for Twitter supports more powerful
    queries for searching public twitter content. 
    +   The [twitteR Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html) provide easy access to the Twitter REST API and 
    handles the sorting of retrieved data through
    class wrappers that provide convenient functions to access
    information. Tweets are part of the _status_ class for example.
    Read the documentation for useful details. 
    +   TwitteR package retrieves majority of information that is of interest,
    if not supported by the twitteR, any arbitrary HTTP request
    can be made to the API to retrieve information.
    +   Twitter provides a live stream API which allows the retrieval 
    of the new updated information on tweeter. This is a unique feature
    and can be used for real-time tracking for events of interest. 
    +   [StreamR](https://github.com/pablobarbera/streamR) provides easy access and convenient use of the stream API
    connecting, saving, parsing of data is all handled. 

*****

*   __Disadvantages:__
    +   Location information is available but often users can fill 
    whatever it desired, thus not most accurate. 
    +   The token produced by twitteR is cached internally and not
    provide easy access to the token for use outside of twitteR functions.
    +   Due to nature of twitter, it is hard to track how users
    react to tweets posted by other users. This is because the replies is not
    directly connected to the post.
