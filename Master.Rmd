#   Summary:

*****

##  Facebook:
*   ___Advantages:___
    +   Easy to retrieve data from facebook API using 
        the functions provided by the __Rfacebook__. 
    +   Easy to access public data of facebook through its [__search API__](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-API/using-graph-API#search).
        Part of the functionality is covered by the _Rfacebook_ package through the _searchGroup &
        searchPages_ function.
    +   Long lived tokens created through registering an facebook application
        does not expire.
    +   Discussions about a post can be easily tracked through extracting
        comments and replies to those comments.
    +   The [graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) tool is useful for testing API 
        calls to understand structure as well as exploring possible fields and edges.
    +   The __Utils.R__ package within _Rfacebook_ provides example frameworks to parse 
        the response JSON nested list into an organized data frame.
    +   To use custom API requests, use the _CallAPI_ function in _Rfacebook_ 
        with the request URL to retrieve response.

*****

*   ___Disadvantages:___
    +   The facebook API documentation does not provide specific information regarding [__Rate         Limit__](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-API/advanced/rate-limiting), 
    it specifies that the limit `differs depending on request`.
    +   facebook API V2.0 and above place heavy restrictions 
        on accessing personal information. Details
        such as profile information, user timeline etc. are not 
        generally publicly available due to privacy settings.
        It is __not recommended__ to scrape the facebook API to search for user related
        information.
    +   To retrieve information regarding nodes, the Id of the node
        is required. This makes tracking objects/searching for
        specific nodes very difficult
        since there is no easy way to obtain the id for specific
        objects of interest (pages, users, comments, etc.)
    +   It was observed that many pages, posts and comments
        does not include _location_ information as part of its content.
