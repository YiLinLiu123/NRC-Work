### Overview:
*   The [Google Web Services API](https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/overview) is divided into multiple subsequent APIs each responsible for offering unique features.
    +   _Directions:_ calculates directions between locations in an optimized manner.
        Allows multiple waypoints (places to visit before reaching destination) as well as multiple routes
        ,modes of travel and traffic model.
    
    +   _Distance Matrix:_ provides travel distance and time for origin and destination pairs.
        Provide parameters to control what to avoid (highway, tolls), mode of travel, 
        traffic model etc.
    
    +   _Elevation:_ provides elevation data for points. 
    
    +   _Geocoding:_ provides geocoding and reverse geocoding. From address to lat/lng pairs 
        and vice versa.
    
    +   _Roads:_ snaps points of travel to closest road and provide closest road to points
                , speed limits, tracking is only for premium users.
    
    +   _Time Zone:_ provides time zone information about a location.
    
    +   _Places:_ Include multiple functionalities.
        +   _Places search:_ allows for search of locations nearby to the provided location,
            the search can be modified via ranking by distance, price, opening now etc.
            
        +   _Place details:_  using a `place_id`, more detailed information regarding the place
        such as rating, address, phone number can be returned.
        
        +   _Place photos:_ allows the user to obtain google server photos for a location.
        
        +   _Place autocomplete:_ allows for autocomplete of a incomplete place text.
        
    +   _Geolocation:_ returns a location and accuracy radius based on information about cell towers 
        and WiFi nodes that the mobile client can detect.

*   __Please refer to the developer documentation for each web service API
    under the _"developer's guide"_ option. Google does an amazing job explaining 
    the full functionality of each web service and provides ample examples.__
    +   __Google Maps APIs often includes _biasing_ of search query results to favor 
        conditions met by parameters.__
        
    +   It is relatively easy to extract information for a list of points by separating via _"|"_ or _","_.

*   All API requests can be made using a __HTTP GET__ request.
    +   Example format: `https:maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/{API Service Name}/{return format: json or xml}?{query}`
    
    +   Example request example: 
        `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Disneyland&destination=Universal+Studios+Hollywood4&key=YOUR_API_KEY`

*   An access key is required and there are quotas restricting access. 
    +    Each web service API have different free usage limits under the _policy and terms_ of the guide.
    

*   An [premium account](https://developers.google.com/maps/premium/usage-limits) is available for purchase 
    which allows access to more functionality and more quota. 
    However, the free access keys are sufficient for most purposes.

*   Similar to other APIs, each object in Google Maps also includes its own Id.

### Rate Limit:
*   [Rate Limit Table](https://enterprise.google.com/maps/pricing/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2016-geo-na-endor-gmedia-search-us-br_bmm_en_refr_hv_price&utm_content=usca%7Cen%7Chybr%7C1001877%7C%7C%7Cbrand%7C%7Crefr_hv_price&utm_term=%2Bgoogle%20%2Bmap%20%2Bapi%20%2Bplans&creative=153855030923&gclid=Cj0KEQiA9P7FBRCtoO33_LGUtPQBEiQAU_tBgK-i1qyj1UvAJCLTGFzlZHbBPsgGs0l6T4mZBUbCka4aAsHz8P8HAQ#compare-editions)

*   __The rate limit information for each web service is also specified under its developer documentation
        under policies and usage.__

*   The dashboard under the google API console provides the usage information for your application.

*   __Quick Summary:__
    +   _Geocoding API:_ 2500 requests per 24 hours as combination of server and client
        side queries. A limit rate of 50 requests per second.
        
    +   _Places API:_ 1000 requests per 24 hours as combination of server and client
        side queries.
        +   maximum limit for free usage is 150,000 requests per 24 hour period if
            billing is enabled.
            
    +   _Elevation API:_ 2500 free requests as a sum of server and client.
        512 locations per request. Up to 50 requests per second.
        
    +   _Directions API:_ 2500 free requests per day, as a sum of server and client.
        Up to 23 waypoints per request. 50 requests per second.

### Sample Queries and Extracting Data:
*   It is recommended to first test out the query in a web browser. 
*   The main packages used are as follows and are available for download on CRAN through _install.packages_:
    +   [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/quickstart.html) to make HTTP requests.
        +   [httr documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/httr.pdf)
    +   [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html) to parse JSON data.

```{r data_Libraries, results ="hide", message=F, error=F, warning=F}
    library(httr);
    library(jsonlite);
    
```


```{r data_RequestExample}
    key = "AIzaSyBGTs-gZCbyP8n0Hvw_VZ76Z6YrST1DNa8"
    host = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api"
    
    ## Extracting location information about NRC library in Ottawa
    request1 = paste(host,"/geocode/json", "?address=NRC+National+Science+Library&key="
                     ,key,sep="")
    
    raw1 = GET(request1)
    
    
    ## Note the actual response data is located under the content information 
    ## and that the content is in raw byte format.
    names(raw1)
    
    ##  Parsing into JSON nested lists/data frames
    response = jsonlite::fromJSON(content(raw1,"text"))
    paste("formatted address:",response$results$formatted_address,sep=" ");

    ##  Then the response needs to be parsed, which will not be done in this example. It is recommended to use 
    ##  the str() function to investigate nesting.
    

```

###  First Thoughts:
*   Google Maps API does an amazing job reporting geographical location and makes it easy to access the data.
    The main difficulty will be parsing the JSON/XML response from the sever. 

*   It is recommended to use Google Maps API to supplement existing geographical data to perform analysis.
    It will be more useful to use google Maps to provide visualizations within R.
