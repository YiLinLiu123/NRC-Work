# Libraries:

*   [exif library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exif/index.html)
    +   Required lots of extra installations, due to not
    being on CRAN yet. 
    +   `devtools::install_github("ironholds/exif")`
    +   Install "Rcpp" package is required
    +   Only returns a fraction of potential metadata

*   Another tool is [exifTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
    +   provides runnables for windows
    +   orginally a PERL library.
    +   [exiftool Instructions](http://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/exiftool-commands.html)



```{r ImageLibraries}

    library(exif)

```


```{r trying To Process Images}

    animal= read_exif("./TestPictures/animal1.jpg")
    lake = read_exif("./TestPictures/lake.jpg")
    # tiger = read_exif("./Test Pictures/tiger.jpg")
    
```



#   exifTool:
*   To use it, change the file name to `exiftool.exe`. 
    Which allows the command prompt to access its' functionalities.
*   [FAQ](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/faq.html)
*   Note that in orde rot use the exiftool, the current directory needs
    to be where the application is at.

*   command used to parse the meta data into JSON format:
    +   `-j` specifies that the output is in json format
    +   '-r` recusiviely go through all image files in the directory 
        `TestPictures`
    +   `exiftool -r -j TestPictures\> image.json`

*   Supports various other output formats: php, html, csv etc...
    Refer to [exif documentations](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exif/index.html) for more details. 

*   Reading in JSON formated data:
```{r Selecting tech within R}

    library(rjson)
    list = fromJSON(file="image.json")

    ## Looking at Model only
    tech = lapply(list, function(x){
                            x$Technology
                        }
                    )
    file = lapply(list,function(x){
                x$FileName
    })
    
    data = cbind(file = as.vector(file),
                      tech= as.vector(tech))
    data
    
```


*   Another method to do this would to select the 
    information of interest using exif and output it
    to a file. 

![Command Prompt Command](./commandLinePrompt.jpg)

*  _-r_ indicates to loop through all image files in 
    the _TestPictures_ directory.
*   _-csv_ specifies that the output is to be comma seperated.
*   _-fileName_,_-technology_, specifies the desired parameters
*   `>tech.text


```{r Exif Selected Data}
    
    data = read.table("tech.txt", header = TRUE, sep=",")
    data

```
