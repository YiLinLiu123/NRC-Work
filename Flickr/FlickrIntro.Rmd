##  Basics of Flickr:
*   [Guide to use Flickr](https://www.cnet.com/news/newbies-guide-to-flickr/)

*   [Guide to API](http://kylerush.net/blog/flickr-api/)

*****

##  Learning API:

*   [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
    +   __NOTE: not supported by Flickr, so might not
            be stable.__
    +   All uses of the API must abide the [community guidelines](https://www.flickr.com/help/guidelines/)

*   Results can be cached for up to 24 hours to 
    reduce API load. 

*   Flickr has its own shortened URL. [Shortened URL](https://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157616713786392)

*   To perform requests, a calling convention is needed, 
    send a request to its endpoint specifying the 
    requried parameters (method,api_key) and other arguments, 
    a formatted response will be recieved.
    +   Endpoint: `https://api.flickr.com/services`

*   All requests/data are expected to be UTF-8 enconded.

*   Multiple response formats are provided: xml, json, REST

*   Oauth is used for authentication. 

*   __Many methods for the API does not seem
    to require a token.__
*   [URLs](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html)
    +   the urls are not returned, instead the parameters required
        to form the urls are provided in the response. Please
        consult the documentation
        


*****

##  Rate Limit:
*   Staying under aggregate 3600 requests per hour per key 
    will be allowed. 

*****

##  Obtaining Authorization: 
*   [API Key](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/)
    +   click on _Request an API Key_ under "Get your API Key"
    +   select non-commercial. 
    +   An call back URL must be specified.

*   [Generating Key](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.oauth.html)
    +   all the listed URLs are available on this website.

*   The token does not seem to have an expiration date.
    
*   __FOR THE FOLLOWING TO WORK, when R opens the popup, 
    change `permission=read` to `perms=read` in the URL.
    The permissions must be specified or the authentication
    page will show `permission set not recognized` error.__

    ![Correct Auth Page](./Pictures/correctAuth.jpg)

```{r Flickr Oauth Token, message=FALSE}
    rm(list = ls())

    library(httr)

    # ##  Retrieved from API Documentation + Generated Key
    # app_Key <- "08adb0273ae63e5c07c249f5a621e7cb"
    # app_Secret <- "89e0a70bfb48e7f4"
    # request_URL <- "https://www.flickr.com/services/oauth/request_token"
    # auth_URL <- "https://www.flickr.com/services/oauth/authorize"
    # access_URL <-"https://www.flickr.com/services/oauth/access_token"
    # 
    # token.endpoints <- oauth_endpoint(request= request_URL, authorize = auth_URL,
    #                                   access = access_URL)
    # token.app <- oauth_app("Testing API",key=app_Key, secret = app_Secret )
    # token <- oauth1.0_token(token.endpoints, token.app,permission='read',cache=F)
    # 
    # 
    # ##  Saving Token:
    # saveRDS(token,file="token.R")
