### Structure:

The Facebook API is in the form of a _graph_:
```{r echo=FALSE,results="asis"}
    
    structure = c(
        "nodes",
        "edges",
        "fields"
    )
    
    description = c(
        "Objects of facebook API. Nodes are \"things\" like Users, page, Group, comments etc. Each node has its' own ID that which is used to access it via the Graph API.",
        "The connections that leads from one node to another. For example: the cover photo of a user, the comments and posts on a user's timeline. Edges are identified by a name",
        "Information about the nodes, like the names, Id, birthday etc of a user.Fields are identified by a name."
    )
    
    summary = data.frame(structure,description)
    knitr::kable(summary,col.names = c("Structure","Description"))
    
    rm(list=ls())

```
