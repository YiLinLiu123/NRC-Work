# Quick Introduction To facebook API:

******


### Structure:

The facebook Graph API (API used to access general facebook data) is in the form of a _graph_:

```{r echo=FALSE,results="asis"}
    
    structure = c(
        "nodes",
        "edges",
        "fields"
    )
    
    description = c(
        "Nodes are like Users, page, groups, comments etc..Each node has its' own unique ID that which is used to access itself via the Graph API.",
        "The connections that leads from one node to another are called edges. For example: the cover photo of a user, the comments and posts on a user's timeline. Edges are identified by a name",
        "Information about the nodes are called fields,like the names, Id, birthdays of a user.Fields are identified by a name."
    )
    
    summary = data.frame(structure,description)
    knitr::kable(summary,col.names = c("Structure","Description"))
    
    rm(list=ls())

```


******

### Request Format:
*   The _API request_ is in the format of a standard HTTP request. 
Methods like __GET,POST, DELETE, etc.__ can be used to retrieve 
and modify information of facebook nodes through the API granted
the correct access token is provided. 

*   Format of a request:  
`GET graph.facebook.com /{node-id}/{edge-name}?fields = {first-level fields}{Second-level fields}`.
    +   The levels of the fields form a pipeline where the fields of the first
        level fields can be accessed as the second level fields.
        
*  An OAuth access token is required to access any information, Rfacebook
    provides functionalities to handle tokens.
    

******

### Pagination:
*   To manage the amount of information returned per API Call, 
facebook divides the data using several pagination techniques
(Cursors-based, Time-based and Offset-based).

*   Most commonly used and the only ones encountered during this report 
    are the curosr based paginations. 
    
*   The information for pagination provides a _next_ token which is a HTTP 
    GET request for the next page of data and a _previous_ token 
    which is a HTTP GET request for the previous page of data. 
    
    +   If the provided paging request call returns _NULL_, the end/very beginning
        of the data is reached.
        
*   [Pagination](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-API/using-graph-API)

 
******  

### Rate Limit:
*   The type of rate limit dealt with mainly in this report is __Application-Level Rate Limiting__.
    Only the application access key was used. [Access Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens)
    
*   The facebook API states that the limit for the application is
    __200 calls per hour per user in aggregate.__ This however means
    if more users uses the application, the rate limit cap increases.
    
*   However not all API calls are subjected to the rate limit. 

*   There is a tool that monitors the application's API calls 
and it is located under the dashboard of the application. [Test Application](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). 
The user would need to be logged in.

#   Other Facebook API:
*   There is __not__ a paid Facebook Graph API.

*   For commercial purposes, Facebook has another
    API called [Marketing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/)
    which is used to manage ad campaigns. 
    

*   Another advertisment based API is the [atlas API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/atlas-apis).
    From a basic google search. [This page](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Facebooks-Atlas-exactly) says that the atlas API uses
    identity of each user to target advertisment.

## Creating Test Account:

*   _First name:_ API-Testing
*   _Last name:_ nrc
*   _Email:_  NRC.API.Testing@gmail.com
*   _Password:_ NRCTesting123456!
*   _Birthday:_   July 1st 1997
*   _Gender:_ Males

******

## Creating token:


*   Normally, a temporary access token normally has a 2-hour expiration time. 
A long-lived token (OAuth token) can be used for longer access. 
The following outlines how to obtain a long-lived token:
    +   __The _fbOAuth_ function documentation in [Rfacebook](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rfacebook/Rfacebook.pdf) outlines the steps.
    +   [Mining facebook Data Using R & facebook API!](https://bigdataenthusiast.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/mining-facebook-data-using-r-facebook-API/) 
    also provides steps to creating a long-lived token.


```{r}

    app_Id = 1353820787971442
    app_Secret = "4841ab73f4f68960ebbf37e5705e2610"
    
    ## The following shows the code that calls the fbOAuth function 
    ## and creates the OAuth token, 
    ## it has been commented once executed and the result 
    ## is saved in a file 
    ## called "my_OAuth.txt" Please run the following code and follow
    ## the instructions printed in the 
    ## console in case the file does not exist.
    
   # token = fbOAuth(app_id = app_Id,app_secret = app_Secret,extended_permissions = TRUE)
   # if(!file.exists("My_OAuth"))
   #  {
   #      file.create("My_OAuth.txt")
   #      save(token, file= "My_OAuth.txt")
   #  }

load("My_OAuth.txt")
   rm(list = setdiff(ls(),c("token","FbObjectId") ))
```

*   The following pictures indicates where to navigate to set the extended permissions.

# Exploring Rfacebook:


******

## _Location:_
___GOAL: To try and explore what the facebook API offer regarding extracting location information.___


### Exploring facebook API for Nodes that Contain Location Information:

```{r location nodes,echo=FALSE,results="asis"}
    
    nodes = c(
        "Albums.",
        "Comments",
        "Events",
        "Pages",
        "Posts",
        "Photos"
        
    )
    
    description = c(
        "Contains location field. Often returns null",
        "No location fields.",
        "Usually includes location information under the place field with a valid location.",
        "Contains a location field, often yields no useful response.",
        "Contains a place field, but usually returns NULL when requested.",
        "Contains a place field for location."
    )
    
    summary = data.frame(nodes,description)
    knitr::kable(summary,col.names = c("Nodes","Description"))



```


******
## _callAPI_ Function:
*   __CHECKED__
*   The "callAPI" function retrieves 
    response for any valid facebook API requests.

*   The main benefit is that the user can 
    pass in any arbitrary API request.
    ex: `https://graph.facebook.com/me?fields=birthday,age_range`
    and pass in the token generated from _fbOAuth_ token. The 
    users will have to parse the returned nested list.

*   Most facebook nodes needs
    to be referenced via its object id for the
    expected response. 

*   Due to personal privacy protection, no useful information
    about other users (who has not granted access to 
    the test application) were returned.

###   Example of using callAPI (to extract test user data):
*   __Checked__
```{r}    

    load("My_OAuth.txt")
    ##  Extracting test user personnal information
    my_Data = callAPI("https://graph.facebook.com/me", token)
    ##  Extracting my ID, this can be passed on as the ids for other functions
    my_id = my_Data$id
    print(my_Data)
    
    ##  Adding fields to the URL to gain specific information (birthday, age_range)
    ##  no spaces anywhere within the URL should be included
    my_Specific_Information_Request = "https://graph.facebook.com/me?fields=birthday,age_range"
    my_Specific_Data = callAPI(my_Specific_Information_Request,token)
    
    print(my_Specific_Data)


```



*****

### Id Function:

*   The goal is to provide the object ID to access basic nodes.
    A simple function is made to extract that information.
    Not valid for complext URLs such as the ones for posts, comments, pictures
    etc.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## ONLY VALID for SIMPLE Webaddresses with no id in the URL, ex: www.facebook.com/harrypotter

    FbObjectId = function(object_URL,token)
    {
        load("My_OAuth.txt")
        beginning_Index = 1
        # Checking the formating of the "object_URL"
        if(class(object_URL)!= "character"){
            warning("Object_URL is not a string")
        }else if( grep(pattern = "(http|https)://www.facebook.com(/.*)*"
                       , x=object_URL)!= beginning_Index ) {
    
             warning("Invalid URL")
        }
        
        #formating and checking the complete URL request to the facebook Graph API 
        complete_URL = paste("https://graph.facebook.com",object_URL,sep = "/")
        #print(complete_URL)
        
        #Extracting the ID of the facebook object
        url_Data = Rfacebook::callAPI(complete_URL,token)
        url_id = url_Data$id
        
        # If the Id is not numeric, something is wrong. 
        if(length( grep(pattern="www.facebook.com",x=url_id))!=0 ) {
              warning("Error In Returned ID: Not numeric values. 
                      URL likely not supported.")
        }
        
      url_id
    }

```


*   Test cases (all cases are behaving as expected)

```{r testing_FbObjectId,error=T, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    
    ## For URLs that yield no ids, the facebook would return a version of the 
    ## URL address as the object ID.(just discovered)

    ## A URL of a post on the public facebook photo of Harry Potter 
    ##(This should also return an error)
    test1 = "https://www.facebook.com/harrypottermovie/photos/
    a.422515109312.180796.156794164312/10155042492264313"
    
    FbObjectId(test1,token)
    
    ## A comment on a public page (This should return an error)    
    test2 = "https://www.facebook.com/harrypottermovie/photos
    /a.422515109312.180796.156794164312/10155042492264313/
    ?type=3&comment_id=10155042702764313&
    comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R4%22%7D"
    FbObjectId(test2,token)
    
    ## A URL of a public facebook page
    test3 = "https://www.facebook.com/harrypottermovie"
    FbObjectId(test3,token)
    
    ## A URL of a person's timeline (not my own)
    test4 = "https://www.facebook.com/FSXAC"
    FbObjectId(test4,token)
     rm(list = setdiff(ls(),c("token","FbObjectId") ))
```



******

## Exploring _getPage,getPost,getCommentReplies_:
*   __CHECKED__

 ___GOAL: To extract information regarding comments on a public facebook webpage___

    1:  Starting with getting the post_Ids (mainly post Ids) using _getPage_
```{r}
    
    require(Rfacebook)

    ##  the getPage function returns a matrix, and one of the
    ##  columns is the "postId"
    BBC_URL = "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"
    load("My_OAuth.txt")
    BBC_Id = FbObjectId(BBC_URL,token)
    print(BBC_Id)

    ## retrieving page information using
    ## getPage function
    page_Information = getPage(BBC_Id,token,n=2)
    names(page_Information)

    ## the post_Ids 
    post_Ids = page_Information$id
```

   
2:  Getting information about each post using _getPost_ 
    (mainly interested in comment ids)
    
```{r}
    ##  trying to see getPost can be vectorized, 
    ##  it appears to be working through the use of lapply

    ## getting all the post information with 
    ## getPost function
    post_Information = lapply(post_Ids,getPost,n=100,token=token)
    
    test <- post_Information[[2]]
    
    names(test)
    
    names(test$post)
    
    names(test$likes)
    
    names(test$comments)
     
```
    
  
3:  Using the _getcommentReplies_ 
    to further investigate each reply to a comment.
    
```{r,error=T }   

    ## Extracting comment_ids

    comments = unlist( lapply(post_Information, function(x) {x["comments"]}), recursive = F)
    comments_Id = unlist(comments[[1]]["id"])
    

    #Extracting the comment replies to each posts' comments.

    ## First test the getCommentReplies with a single comment_Id:
    single_Comment_Reply = getCommentReplies(comments_Id[[1]],token=token)
    names(single_Comment_Reply)
    names(single_Comment_Reply$replies)
    
    
    ##Now for all of the comment Ids via lapply.
    
    comment_Replies = lapply(comments_Id, function(x) getCommentReplies(x,token = token))
    
    length(comment_Replies)
   
```

```{r,echo = F}
   rm(list = setdiff(ls(),c("folder_Path","token","FbObjectId") ))
```




******

## Exploring _searchGroup & getGroup_ functions:
*   __CHECKED__

* ___GOAL: To extract information regarding a public facebook group: 
[couponboutique](https://www.facebook.com/groups/couponboutique2/) 
using the getGroup function___


1:  Suppose the ID is not known, or not certain. _searchGroup()_ can be used to extract the group_Id:
```{r error=TRUE}
    
    load("My_OAuth.txt")
    group_Name = URLencode("The Coupon Boutique")
    group_Id = searchGroup(group_Name,token=token)
    print(group_Id)
     
```



```{r}
    ##  Also works when URLencoding the search string
    group_Name_URL = URLencode("The Coupon Boutique")
    group_Id2 = searchGroup(group_Name_URL,token=token)
    print(group_Id2)
```



2: Extracting information using _getGroups_
```{r, error=TRUE}
    start_Time = as.numeric(as.POSIXct("2016-12-01"))
    id = group_Id2$id[[1]]
   
    ##  This id was manually verfied to be 
    ##  the group that is listed at the top
    print(id)
    
    ## NOTE: the "groupId" is different from the "pageId" 
    ## where the group is posting and hosting. 
    
    #NOTE: the default number of posts to return is 25.
    group_posts = getGroup(id,token=token)
    class(group_posts)
    names(group_posts)
    rm(list = setdiff(ls(),c("folder_Path","token","FbObjectId") ))
    
```



******

## Exploring _searchPage_:
*   This method works as shown in the documentation.
```{r}
    keyword ="Apples"
    data = searchPages(keyword,token, n=100)
    class(data)
   names(data)

```





******

## Trying _getLikes_:
*   ___GOAL:The documentation stated that it could provide information about 
a user or a page's likes given the id.___
*   ___Does not work on users but work on pages.___


******
